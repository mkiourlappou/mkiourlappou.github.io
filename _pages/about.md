I am a PhD student at [Ilan Davis lab](http://www.ilandavis.com/) at the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Oxford. I am under the supervision of Ilan Davis and Stephen Taylor and I am collaborating with Charlotte Deane head of the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford.

I am funded by the UKRI BBSRC and by [Zegami](https://zegami.com/), an Oxford University spin out company for data visualisation and pattern recognition using artificial intelligence. 

Previously, I studied Physics at the University of Cambridge where I obtained a MSci and a BA.

I am an avid runner and I love participating in running events and running outdoors. 

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the application of machine learning algorithms on answering complex biological questions related to small and sparse biological datasets.

I study how gene expression in tissue can provide insights into post-transcriptional regulation. To do so, I use machine learning to uncover patterns in a combination of data including, mRNA and protein expression data, gene features and pathway information.

### 2020

Checkout our paper, published in RNA [Ribo-Pop: Simple, cost-effective, and widely applicable ribosomal RNA depletion](https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.076562.120).

### 2019

I was a winner of the competition "What is the biggest challenge or greatest opportunity for AI in the future?". I presented my idea on the AI@Oxford conference in September 2019.

I was selected to attend MLSS 2019 (Machine Learning Summer School) where I presented a poster on my work.
